# A thousand miles start with a single step.

Lambdata_cocoisland is the first step to adding on useful libraries and functions for the development of Data Science study.

# Usage
TrainValTest_split.split(X,y) requires a two or more dimensions dataframe of numerical values for variable X and a series of numeric or object value for variable y. This function splits the X dataframe into several smaller dataframes for the purpose of training, validating and testing the data model.
